              Natural physical limitations and constraints may limit the development of a perfectly correct technique. When dancers allow their technique to slip – usually due to fatigue or limited understanding about healthy functioning– they put themselves at a much higher risk of injury. 
              
              As with all sports and athletic disciplines, expert teaching and coaching for the development of technical knowledge is vital. Teachers and coaches must have deep understanding of dance kinesiology and injury prevention. Purpose-built (suspended) dance floors are vital in rehearsal and performance spaces. These resilient floors help with impact from jumping. Ambient temperature of rehearsal studio and performance space is of utmost performance in avoiding dance injury. Mastery of dance requires extensive practice, however care should be taken to avoid chronic injury.

              Ankle Injuries are the most common traumatic (or acute) injury in dancers. 
              Most dancers will experience their first sprain by age 13. This injury is caused by any movement that forces the ankle outside of the normal range of motion, resulting in an overstretching or in tears to the ligaments of the ankle. There are many injuries that can occur at the foot and ankle complex. However, the most common injuries are lateral ankle sprains, achilles tendonitis, metatarsal stress fractures and tibialis posterior strain/tears. Lateral ankle sprains and metatarsal stress fractures (also known as ‘Dancer’s Fracture’ which affects the distal shaft of the fifth metatarsal) are closely related. The mechanism involves an inward rotation whilst the foot is axially loaded in a plantar-flexed position. (McCormack et al. 2018). Prem et al. (2016) found 23% of dancers suffered with chronic ankle instability, which subsequently predisposes them to ‘dancers fracture’. Inversion injuries such as these can cause secondary pathologies including osteochondral lesions to the talus and posterior impingement (Smith et al. 2015). Therefore, physiotherapists need to be vigilant when assessing foot and ankle injuries in dancers to ensure other injuries are not missed, causing problems later down the line. Ankel sprains for dancers on pointe are particularly common.

              Dancing can take a physical toll on your body. Joints and tendons in the knees that can see excessive wear and tear from repetitive movements are especially prone to injury. There are several knee problems to be aware of.
              Patellofemoral Syndrome
              This syndrome causes pain in the front of your knee and kneecap which is especially noticeable when it is painful to put weight on a bent knee in situations like walking down stairs or jumping. Usually caused by poor leg alignment due to unequal lateral pull from the quadriceps, common, external rotation of a dancer’s knee joint can wear down the cartilage in this area.
              Patellar Tendonitis
              Pronation and other improper foot alignments can strain and inflammation of your patellar tendon. This results in patellar tendonitis, which can start out only being painful only during times of activity but advance into continuous pain. Unless you take immediate action, the tendon can tear or degenerate.
              Iliotibial Band Syndrome
              If you have pain or tenderness toward the outside of your knee, especially after you dance, you may have iliotibial band syndrome. Dancers with uneven legs or weak lateral hip muscles are especially prone to this syndrome. Physical therapy can help strengthen the specific muscles necessary for healthy dancing and reduce pain while dancing.

              Dancers typically have loose ligaments and shallow hip sockets (dysplasia) that enable upwards of 160 degrees of flexion when most other hips are limited to 120 degrees before impingement occurs between the ball and socket (hip impingement). But, there’s a catch – the shallow hip socket relies much more on the labrum and surrounding soft tissue structures for stability and as a result, ballet dancers frequently suffer from labral tears, hip flexor tendonitis, and cartilage damage. Hip dysplasia is a double-edged sword for dancers, simultaneously permitting extraordinary performance while predisposing to injury. By being diligent with foundational stretching/strengthening exercises and ensuring adequate time for recuperation, dancers can still enjoy a long and healthy career doing what they love most.

Muscle Pull in Quadratus Lumborum

Symptoms: In women, this typically happens in the lowermost part of the back, while in men, it occurs higher up, where the thoracic spine joins the lumbar. It feels like localized tenderness when you move (with no radiation down the leg).

Causes: In younger dancers, it's often caused by upper-body weakness. It can also happen to men when they lift off-balance.

Recovery: This injury heals easily with relative rest. "If it's achy, dancers can work with it," Hamilton says, "but if it's disabling, a week of rest helps." It can, however, become a chronic condition, persisting for several months. In that case, treatment involves a strengthening program, especially for the core.
Facet Derangement

Symptoms: The joints in the back get locked up, which generally feels like a spasm.

Cause: This happens most typically when forward or backward bending is combined with spinal rotation.

Recovery: This can put you out for a week. Acupuncture, massage and rest can help.
Stress Fractures of the Lower Back

Symptoms: Back pain might radiate up or down the spine and into the glutes. It will be particularly acute in an arabesque.

Causes: Overtraining, bad posture and mechanics (hyperflexibility in one part of the back, stiffness in another), or impacting the bone over and over during jump landings until it fractures. This is common among women and adolescent males.

Recovery: Physical therapy usually lasts for several months and involves a lot of reeducation and strengthening.

A related issue: There is a difference between a stress fracture and a stress reaction. "If you take a paper clip and bend it, it eventually breaks," Hamilton explains. That is a fracture. A reaction is "when you bend a paper clip, but it hasn't broken yet. If you don't stop, it will break." A fracture shows up on X-ray. A reaction will light up, but no crack will show, and it has a much faster healing rate. If you have a reaction, allow yourself relative rest, which means cutting back on—but not eliminating—activity. "Take away the activities that caused the reaction," Bornstein says. "You don't want a reaction to turn into a fracture."
